-----

Create settings.yml: `cp config/settings.example.yml config/settings.yml`,
and add your own CMS username/password.

Transferring The Database
-------------------------

### Dump Database - Production

Run as `deploy` user.

    pg_dump -U postgres -h localhost dinesafe_production -f ~/db_dumps/dinesafe_production_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).dump --password --format=c

### Download Database - Production

    rsync --partial --progress --rsh=ssh <user>@<hostname>:~/db_dumps/<filename>.dump db/dumps/

### Dump Database

    pg_dump  -U mruten dinesafe_dev -f doc/database_dumps/dinesafe_dev_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).dump --format=c

### Load Database

    pg_restore -d database_name doc/database_dumps/filename.dump

NOTE: On production, make sure to switch to postgres user.

Update Sitemap XML
------------------

It's important to update the sitemap.xml file for SEO purposes.

Run this on server to generate sitemap and ping search engines:

    rake sitemap:refresh

Or, generate sitemap but don't ping search engines:

    rake sitemap:refresh:no_ping

TODO: Move sitemap updating to a cron job.

Rake Tasks
----------

**Run this to update all Dinesafe data:**

    rake dinesafe:update_data

Or, you can run individual tasks as needed.

Update XML from Toronto Open Data:

    rake dinesafe:update_xml

Import XML to database (will only add/update changed records):

    rake dinesafe:xml_import

Geocode addresses that need it (updates geocodes table):

    rake dinesafe:geocode

Update establishment addresses from geocodes (and create blank Geocodes for unknown addresses):

    rake dinesafe:update_latlngs

Fix typos (based on list of manual fixes in task):

    rake dinesafe:fix_data_typos

Vagrant
-------

You can use Vagrant to run the app in a virtual machine.

* Install Vagrant, Parallels. (With some modification, could use VirtualBox instead.)
* `vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef-nochef`

* `vagrant up`

Then run these commands on the VM:

* `vagrant ssh` to connect to the VM
* `cd /vagrant`
